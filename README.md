## Earthquake_Challenge

# Overview

To distinguish & organize the data in relation to the tectonic plates location in earth and to identify all earthquakes with magnitude of 4.5+ on the map. Also, to lay out the data on the third map as an overview.
In overall, it is to identify the relation between the tectonic plates & the earthquake locations.

# Results

We used GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website to obtain the geographical coordinates. 
In order to load the data on the maps, we visit mapbox.com & register to obtain the token key. In the config.js file, we would insert the API_KEY info to integrate.

Below is the general street map & sat map for Tectonic data & the actual earthquake data.
